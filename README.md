## üß† Project Overview

This project performs **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  on a worldwide layoffs dataset (from 2020 to 2025) to identify patterns and trends related to layoffs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Using SQL, I explored layoffs by industry, company, country, year, and company stage, uncovering how different sectors were impacted and how global layoff trends evolved over time.
